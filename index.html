    <h3>What I do in my past time</h3>
    <p>
      During my free time, I enjoy to learn about topics I do not learn about in school, or go deeper in to topics we do learn. For example, zoology, I find nature and especialy animals to be very interesting. In the spring I would like to build a chicken coup in my back yard and raise some chickens. This would not only give us free eggs, but it would also be a fun hobby. I also play the fiddle, I have been playing for 10 years.

      <h3>My favorite school subject</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
  My favorite school subject is science. I used to dislike science due to it being in french but now that it is in english, I enjoy it, I am always asking question on how sertain things work the way the work. Science class answers these questions for me. I also find it to be easy because I can remeber the information easily. Last year it was the class I did the best it. Science will also help me with my goal of becoming a zooligist.
